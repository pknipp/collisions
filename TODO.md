TO DO:

prevent an added particle from overlapping w/any existing ones
determine if real-time sorting of n^2 interactions would be more performant than only looking for one w/min dt.

Make each object a separate component (ie, make this approach more OO)

Enable user to throw an object.

Decide between two directions below:
1) general n, controls (density, diameter, position, speed, direction, coefficient of restitution, angular speed?), wall reflectivity, and meters (speeds and angles)
buttons, checkboxes, etc:
walls: reflect, none, temperature-controlled, periodic?

use arrows to indicate velocity?
tabulate individual and/or total momenta and/or KE?

1- and 2-d versions of this would be similar to PhET's ["Collision Lab"](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/collision-lab/latest/collision-lab_all.html)

2) higher n, stat-mech demo, Maxwellian comparison, controlling T of walls
(Similar to PhET's ["Gas properties"](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/gas-properties)
