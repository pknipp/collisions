TO DO:

Make each object a separate component (ie, make this approach more OO)

Enable user to set inputs (like for TSP?).

Enable user to throw an object.

Decide between two directions below:
1) general n, controls (mass, diameter, position, speed, direction, coefficient of restitution, angular speed?), wall reflectivity, and meters (speeds and angles)
buttons, checkboxes, etc:
walls: reflect, none, temperature-controlled, periodic?
when adding additional spheres:
randomize or keep same (as previous line): each item EXCEPT for position
max/min values (if "randomize" is clicked) for each item which has something randomized

units to use: px, s, arbs (for mass)
use blackness to indicate density?
use arrows to indicate velocity?

1- and 2-d versions of this would be similar to PhET's ["Collision Lab"](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/collision-lab/latest/collision-lab_all.html)

2) higher n, stat-mech demo, Maxwellian comparison, controlling T of walls
(Similar to PhET's ["Gas properties"](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/gas-properties)
