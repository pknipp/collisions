TO DO:

Get dots to render before START button is clicked.
Make button render atop any dots which may overlap with it.

Make each object a separate component (ie, make this approach more OO)

Enable user to set inputs (like for TSP?).

Enable user to throw an object.

Decide between two directions below:
1) n = 2, controls (masses, IC, angular speed, coefficient of restitution) and meters (speeds and angles)

1- and 2-d versions of this would be similar to PhET's ["Collision Lab"](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/collision-lab/latest/collision-lab_all.html)

2) higher n, stat-mech demo, Maxwellian comparison, controlling T of walls
(Similar to PhET's ["Gas properties"](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/gas-properties)
