TO DO:
Make 3-d (mass is proportional to CUBE of diameter).

Enable user to set inputs (like for TSP?).

Enable user to throw an object.

Enable RUN/PAUSE button.

Decide between two directions below:
1) n = 2, controls (masses, IC, coefficient of restitution) and meters (speeds and angles)
2) higher n, stat-mech demo, Maxwellian comparison, controlling T of walls
